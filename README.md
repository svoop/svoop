Hello World! üëã

I love to code ever since I came across [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) as a kiddo. A few programming languages and the rise of the Interweb later, [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) paid the bills, but almost killed all the fun. Enter [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) in the mid 2000s where I found my coder happiness again. And when in need of speed, [Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)) is my weapon of choice these days.

This goes to all the Ruby doomsday prophets: Please take a look [at how contributions to Matz' standard Ruby implementation](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/graphs/contributors) evolve before you even think about writing yet another one of those those annoying "[10 reasons](https://dev.to/svoop/10-reasons-why-2023-is-dead-and-2024-is-still-relevant-in-2024-49gb) why Ruby is dead" clickbaits.

Aside from my bread-and-butter works, I regularly create new or contribute to existing open-source projects. Here's a [list of my current source repos on GitHub](https://github.com/svoop?tab=repositories&type=source) some of which are related to [gliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding), my favourite of hobbies.

Thank you for supporting free and open-source software by sponsoring me [here on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/svoop) or on [Donorbox](https://donorbox.com/bitcetera). Any gesture is appreciated, from a single Euro for a ‚òïÔ∏è cup of coffee to üçπ early retirement.
